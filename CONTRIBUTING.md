# How to Contribute

Contributions here are more than welcomed! You can contribute to [rector-src](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-src) repository or one of [extension packages](https://github.com/rectorphp/).

## Preparing Local Environment

1. Fork the [rector/rector-src](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-src) repository and clone it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-name>/rector-src.git
cd rector-src
```

2. We use PHP 8.1 and composer

Install dependencies and verify your local environment:

```bash
composer update
composer check-platform-reqs
```

*Note: using Docker for contributing is strongly discouraged, as it requires [extra knowledge of composer internals](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/9368#issuecomment-718112361).*

Then you can start working with the code :+1:

Do you want to **contribute a failing test**? [This tutorial will show you how](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/main/docs/how_to_add_test_for_rector_rule.md)

## Preparing Pull Request

3 steps will make your pull-request easy to merge:

- **1 feature per pull-request**
- **new features need tests**
- CI must pass

We would be happy to accept PRs that follow these guidelines.
